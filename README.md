# ðŸš§ CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT! ðŸš§
Not ready to use. Check out plans and what was done for now below

## Infrastructure
### Platform (NodeJS)
All template based on NodeJS as universal tool for JavaScript/TypeScript developers. All commands are described in the package.json scripts.

### Package manager (pnpm)
For this project [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) was picked. You can check advantages and why it's better than npm or yarn [here](https://refine.dev/blog/pnpm-vs-npm-and-yarn/#advantages-of-pnpm).

### Monorepo
This template was build as [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo). It means that you can control all your applications and their dependencies from one place. However, you can still use every app independently.

## Backend
### Philosophy
TBD

### Primary tech stack
- Platform: NodeJS
- Language: TypeScript with [tsx](https://github.com/esbuild-kit/tsx) (TypeScript Execute)
- Web server: [koa](https://koajs.com/)
- Sockets: [socketIO](https://socket.io/)
- Database: PostgreSQL with [kysely](https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely) (SQL query builder)
- Logs: [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston), [chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk)
- Validation: [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)
- Other: [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint), [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

### TypeScript configuration
There are two options to run TS:
- Build by tsc. You need to run `make:build` and `start:build` script from package.
- Execute by [tsx](https://github.com/esbuild-kit/tsx). You need to run `start:memory` or `start:dev:memory` with watch flag.

A few things you should know:
- TypeScript module system compiles to ES Modules, not legacy CommonJS. It's needed to support all modern libraries (like chalk v5).
- TypeScript configurated to work with aliases (like `@/application/user/...`). It's already handled by package scripts (see above).
- TypeScript is also configurated to work with legacy decorators (see known issues)

#### Why not [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node)?
There were issues to make it work with aliases and ES Modules. Tsx already handling all this out-of-box. As a nice addition, it's pretty fast.

## FAQ
### Can I use other programming languages except JS/TS?
Sure, you can do it. You can use any others programming languages for your apps; it's not a restriction that template is based on NodeJS. Just prepare package.json scripts if you need or write your own bash scripts.
